# Visual Resume

This is a template for you to use if you're interested in creating a visual resume. It's a Visio file that you can grab and use as a starting point. There's a PNG file to show you a picture of what the output looks like.

**NOTE:** I'm no longer with Falafel Software, and am currently an Executive Consultant with Pillar Technology. Also, I run as an indie on the side via Guidepost Systems. I was too lazy to update this before pushing it on Easter Sunday. Besides, I have to finish this so I can go eat a chocolate bunny the size of my son's head.

Do whatever you want with this, just don't plagarize my life as yours, OK?

Best of luck.

Chat me up on Twitter (@aJimHolmes) or mail Jim@GuidepostSystems.com if you'd like, but please don't expect me to build your resume for you. Unless you want to pay me, but frankly there are better ways to spend your money!
